Ultimate YouTube Downloader üêç
A powerful, user-friendly command-line tool built with Python to download YouTube videos, audio, and entire playlists with full control over quality. This script is designed to be a safe, ad-free, and reliable alternative to sketchy websites, featuring a modern CLI and an automatic setup process for all its dependencies.

Why This Project?
The internet is flooded with YouTube downloader websites that are often slow, filled with intrusive ads and pop-ups, and limit your download quality. This project was born out of the need for a clean, powerful, and reliable solution that puts the user in control.

This script solves the biggest problems with online downloaders:

No Ads or Sketchy Redirects: A clean, safe experience directly in your terminal.

No Quality Limitations: Download videos in their original quality, up to 4K/8K.

No Hassle with Dependencies: The script automatically handles the installation of FFmpeg, the most critical (and often trickiest) dependency for high-quality downloads.

‚ú® Key Features
Automatic FFmpeg Installer: On its first run, the script detects if FFmpeg is missing, asks for permission, and automatically downloads and sets it up for you. This unlocks high-quality downloads without any manual setup.

Full Video Quality Selection: For any single video, the script fetches a list of all available resolutions (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K) and lets you choose your preferred quality.

Smart Playlist Handling:

Automatically detects playlist URLs.

Asks for your desired maximum quality (e.g., 1080p) to apply to all videos.

Downloads and neatly organizes all files into a folder named after the playlist.

Audio Quality Selection: Choose your desired audio quality (Best, Good, Standard) to balance file size and fidelity. When FFmpeg is available, audio is saved in the universal .mp3 format.

Modern & Intuitive CLI: Built with the rich library for a beautiful, user-friendly interface with clear prompts, colors, and progress indicators.

Safe & Reliable Engine: Powered by yt-dlp, the industry-standard tool for video downloading, ensuring maximum compatibility and reliability.
